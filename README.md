# Angular Starterkit

## Requirements

+ [Node](http://nodejs.org/) version >0.10
+ [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) >2.5
+ [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) >3.4

## Installation

1. Clone starterkit repository.
2. Copy it's contents to a new local directory or switch the repositories origin to your repository endpoint.
3. Commit to your repository.
2. Run `npm install` within the root of your local repository.
3. Run one of the gulp tasks depending on the need.

## Gulp Tasks

Available tasks include:

1. **`run-debug`**
2. **`run-inspect`** *(Not currently implemented)*
3. **`run-tests`**
4. **`build-release`**

These tasks are located in the tasks folder in the root directory of the repository.

Running these tasks is all handled through npm scripts.

1. To run the `run-debug` gulp task run the npm command `npm start`
2. To run the `run-tests` gulp task run the npm command `npm test`
3. To run the `build-release` gulp task run the npm command `npm run-script release`

## Browser Synchronization

There is no baked in support for browser synchronization in this starterkit. For browser synchronization (e.g. live reload) during project development you have your choice of tools to use. We kept the starterkit agnostic in this respect to keep the gulp file as simple as possible. There are a number of choices that you have though:

1. [Ghostlab](http://vanamco.com/ghostlab/)
2. [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/)
3. [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/)
